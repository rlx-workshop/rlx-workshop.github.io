<h3>Livestream</h3>
<div class="break"></div>
<p>Throughout the day we will be livestreaming invited talks, contributed talks, spotlight presentations, and a live panel discussion. Please see the <a href="/schedule.html">Schedule</a> for details on what is being streamed when.</p>
<p>During the livestream, please also join the Rocket Chat to discuss the workshop content with other participants and to ask questions of our speakers.</p>

<div class="row">
<h3>Panel</h3>
<div class="break"></div>
<p>Our <a href="/speakers.html">invited speakers and panelists</a> will discuss a mix of curated and audience questions. Topics of discussion are available on the <a href="https://app.sli.do/event/xxrtocoj/live/questions" target="_blank">Sli.do</a>, though submission is now closed.</p>
</div>

<div class="row">
<h3>"Poster" Sessions</h3>
<div class="break"></div>
<p>For each paper being presented at the workshop, we will host (1) the pre-recorded presentation from SlidesLive, (2) a RocketChat chatroom for text-based discussion, and (3) a Zoom meeting room. All of these can be found from each paper's landing page (which you can access by visiting the <a href="/papers.html">Papers</a> page and then clicking on the relevant paper).</p>
<p>The Zoom meeting rooms will be open only during the poster session timeslots (see the <a href="/schedule.html">Schedule</a>), during which authors will join the meeting rooms to allow you to ask them questions face-to-face. We encourage you to first watch the presentation associated with the paper, and then join the Zoom meeting room to ask questions and engage in further discussion.</p>
</div>

<div class="row">
<h3>Meet and Greet</h3>
<div class="break"></div>
<p>To try to replicate the in-person aspect of workshops, we are hosting a virtual meet-and-greet. This is based on the <a href="https://neuromatch.io/instructions">Neuromatch "mind-matching" model</a>. Sign ups are now closed.</p>
<p>We will match participants with up to three other people (four total) who have similar interests and who can meet during the same 30-minute timeslot. Then, we will set up a videochat meeting for you to meet and talk about whatever you would like!</p>
