      <td><b><a href="https://misovalko.github.io/index.html"> Michal Valko </a></b>  is a machine learning scientist in Google DeepMind Paris and a tenured researcher at Inria. Michal is primarily interested in designing algorithms that would require as little human supervision as possible. This means 1) reducing the “intelligence” that humans need to input into the system and 2) minimizing the data that humans need to spend inspecting, classifying, or “tuning” the algorithms. That is why he is working on methods and settings that can deal with minimal feedback, such as deep reinforcement learning, bandit algorithms, or self-supervised learning.
