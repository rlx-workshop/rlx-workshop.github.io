      <td><b><a href="https://dorsa.fyi/">Dorsa Sadigh</a></b> is an assistant professor at Stanford University. My research interests lie at the intersection 
        of robotics, machine learning, and control theory. Specifically, her group is interested in developing efficient 
        algorithms for safe, reliable, and adaptive human-robot and generally multi-agent interactions.</td>

      <td><b><a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~akshay/">Akshay Krishnamurthy</a></b> is a principal researcher at Microsoft Research NYC.
        Previously, he spent two years as an assistant professor in the College of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of 
        Massachusetts, Amherst. His research interests are in machine learning and statistics and he is most excited about interactive learning.

      <td><b><a href="https://alexgkendall.com/">Alex Kendall </a></b> is the co-founder and CEO of Wayve, the London-based company pioneering AI 
        technology to enable autonomous vehicles to drive in complex, never-seen-before environments. Before founding Wayve, 
        Alex was a research fellow at Cambridge University where he earned his Ph.D. in Computer Vision and Robotics. He 
        has been selected on the Royal Academy of Engineering's SME Leaders Programme and named on the Forbes 30 Under 30 innovators list.

      <td><b><a href="https://sites.google.com/corp/view/riedmiller/home/"> Martin Riedmiller </a></b> is a research scientist and 
        former professor for machine learning and now a team lead at DeepMind. His core scientific interest are intelligent machines, 
        that are able to autonomously learn new things from scratch. He is particular interested in neural networks and 
        their ability to store and generalize information.

      <td><b><a href="https://twkillian.github.io/"> Taylor Killian</a></b> is a PhD student at MIT who focuses on using reinforcement Learning to 
        assist clinical decision making. He works in the fields of reinforcement learning, machine learning, and causal inference. He has long 
        been interested in decision making and the mechanisms by which humans summarize and reason about the world. In my work, I aim to develop models and algorithms that enable actors (whether human or not) to efficiently 
        make decisions in the face of various forms of uncertainty.

Invited speakers would be part of a lively panel, which would be livestreamed during the workshop.

<!-- <div class="row">
  <p> <h3>Retrospectives Panel</h3> </p>
  <p> In addition to the speakers above, we will have a restrospectives panel amongst the <a href="https://offline-rl-neurips.github.io/speakers.html">panelists</a> from the first offline RL workshop to discuss how their viewpoints and beliefs have changed about different aspects of offline RL in terms of challenges, important open problems, etc. Panelists include Sergey Levine, Emma Brunskill, Nando De Freitas, Finale Doshi-Velez. This panel would be moderated by Nan Jiang. </p>
