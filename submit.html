We will encourage discussions and contributions around (but not limited to) the following topics that are important in the context of utilizing offline RL as a launchpad:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Re-using / transferring existing offline RL agents (i.e., <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01626.pdf" style="color:#808080;"> reincarnating RL </a>) </li>
<li> Transfer and generalization of offline RL policies: multi-task and meta-learning </li>
<li> Pre-training and learning from general-purpose, but unrelated data </li>
<li> Representation learning for offline RL, and offline RL as a way of representation learning </li>
<li> Effective methods for fine-tuning offline RL policies, especially to novel problem scenarios </li>
<li> Fast adaptation and meta-learning of offline RL policies </li>
<li> Effective exploration via skills learned from offline data </li>
<li> Sample-efficient online RL via iterated offline RL or deployment-efficient offline RL </li>
<li> Learning to explore safely using offline data, especially in the presence of other agents </li>
</ul>

<p> We shall accept submissions of up to 4-5 pages of content (with no limit on references and appendix) that have not been previously accepted at an archival venue (such as ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR). 
  <!-- While up to 6 pages of content is allowed, we strongly encourage authors to limit their submission to 4-6 pages, to ensure higher quality reviewer feedback.  -->
Papers can utilize any style file they want (for e.g., ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR) and should be anonymized for double blind review. We'll try to ensure that each paper receives 3 reviews. </p>

<p> <b> Evaluation Criteria</b>: We plan to evaluate papers on clarity, potential impact, significance, and novelty of the proposed ideas. We are happy to accept works-in-progress to encourage discussion at the workshop. All accepted papers will be advertised on the workshop website in the form of a poster or recorded talk videos and camera-ready papers and are non-archival. 
We will also select a small number of papers as contributed talks, which would be presented live during the in-person workshop.
